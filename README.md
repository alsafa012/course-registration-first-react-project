01:This project is based on course enrollment.
The following three features of my project written below :

-    In my project, there is a button, and when you click on the button, you can see information's about Courses and also by clicked button some mathematical operations execute automatically like total credits, remaining total credit, and also total price.
-    You cannot select same course in a multiple times. If you attempt to do so, it will display a sweet-alert.
-    If the remaining credit becomes too low, it will also show an alert. Similarly, if the total credit exceeds a certain limit, it will also show an alert.

02:Discussing how I managed the state in my assignment project.

-    First I use "useEffect" for fetch my json data and display these data in my 9 cards.
-    then i use "useState" to hold or store selected data, when i click on the select button ,it display needed data those data that are stored in useState . Then i use it to store total credit hour , remaining credit hour and Total Price so that i can display them.
